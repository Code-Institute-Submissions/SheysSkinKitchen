### Surface 
 
#### Colour Scheme 

I wanted a simple colour scheme, so I went 3 colours white (#FFFFFF), black (#000000), and orange (#E19B74). 
 
Black and white was chosen to make it simple and the orange was chosen as it is the exact match of the photo on the homepage. 
 
Add photo of colours with codes. 
 
#### Typography
 
I picked 2 fonts to be used one for headers and one for general text. 
 
The 2 fonts are Amatic SC for headers and Abel for general text. 
 
Photo of the 2 fonts 
 
#### Images
 
Other than the product images only 1 other image has been used on the homepage to give a warm welcome feel that colour scheme was based around this photo as the background was orange and therefor orange was added to the colour scheme.
 
It is of hands with cream on them representing what the site sells Skin care e.g., creams. 
 
### Skeleton 
 
Once all the pages have been chosen and a design accepted, I then went to design each page on Adobe XD see below all the wireframes for each page.
 
* [Home Wireframe]()
* [Sign Up Wireframe]()
* [Sign in Wireframe]()
* [Profile Wireframe]()
* [Review Wireframe]()
* [Recover Password Wireframe]()
* [Products search Wireframe]()
* [Product Wireframe]()
* [Shopping Bag Wireframe]()
* [Checkout Wireframe]()
* [Order Confirmation Wireframe]()
* [Contact Us Wireframe]()
* [Add a Product Wireframe]()
* [Edit a Product Wireframe]()


While designing I also created 2 wireframes which will no longer be created

* [Payment Details Wireframe]()
* [Add a Card Wireframe]()


### Structure 
 
The navbar and footer has access to everything that the type of user will need. 

#### Data Tables 

All the data is stored in MySQL and Django to manage the storage as well.

All the data tables to be added is

**Site users**

Show images of table in Django

**Products**

Show images of table in Django

**Product sizes and prices**

Show images of table in Django

**Reviews**

Show images of table in Django

**Purchases Made**

Show images of table in Django

**Basket**

Show images of table in Django

### Scope 

Once all the user stories have been complete all the features needed for the site to meet the user stories are detailed below. 

**Sign up/in with social media**

I have done it so its easier for users to sign up or in by just connecting to social media or sign up through there email if they wish. 

**User experience edit profile and delivery details**

Each user can easily log in and out with no problems. If a user forgets there password they can easily recover it with their email. They can also save there delivery address to save them time if there a frequent customer and don't want to write there address every time they make a purchase 

**Payment Details saved no longer will be done**

While designing I wanted a user to save their card details to save time when purchasing items but was informed about the security risk and the various laws around it. As internet browsers now save those details I thought it better it take this out to avoid any security issues.

**Basket**

The total in the basket will always be shown in the navbar to let the shopper know how much is always in their basket.  

**Reviews**

Once a shopper has signed up and has purchased an item. They can leave a review for others to see and then once a new shopper has come to the site they will then be able to see the reviews of the product and also filter products on the best rated 

**Checkout and Order confirmation**

When a shopper has purchased something, they will receive an email confirmation of what they have purchased and an order confirmation page which will detail what they have brought and all the information they have provided. So shoppers will be able to have s record of what they have purchased 

**Store owner to add, edit and delete a product**

The store owner will be able to add products to the store for shoppers to purchase. They can then edit the item in the future if they wish to put it on sale or add more stock for example and then delete the product of they wish to no longer sell it. This is done by have form set up for them to allow this to happen. 
 
**Add multiple sizes and prices for a product** 

The store owner can save multiple sizes which will have different prices until each product. This is to avoid having the product save in twice under 2 products. This will make it easier to manage as the store owner can see everything associated with the product in one page when they add or edit. 


**Check for any available stock before payment**

Before a shopper purchases a product, it will make sure there is enough stock for what they want in case 2 people buy the same product at the same time and the product is out of stock. 


### Strategy 
 
My aim for this project is to build a website where all the user stories are met above. As a shopper, site user and store owner. Once I have outlined all the requirements, I will come up with a design scheme where I will make sure all wireframes made meet all the requirements of the user stories and design scheme. 

## Features

In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.
 
### Existing Features
- Feature 1 - allows users X to achieve Y, by having them fill out Z
- ...

For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them, although this is entirely optional.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

### Features Left to Implement
- Another feature idea

## Technologies Used

In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

- [JQuery](https://jquery.com)
    - The project uses **JQuery** to simplify DOM manipulation.


## Testing

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

## Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:
- Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
- Different configuration files?
- Separate git branch?

In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
